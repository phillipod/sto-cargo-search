# Acknowledgement

## STO Cargo Search

This project, **STO Cargo Search**, gratefully acknowledges the following:

### Star Trek Online Community Developers (STOCD)

The **Star Trek Online Community Developers (STOCD)** and their project, [**SETS - STO Equipment and Trait Selector**](https://github.com/STOCD/SETS).

During the initial development of this tool, Cargo files downloaded and maintained by the SETS tool were used as a reference and dataset. As a result, renamed fields and limits are very similar.

Although **STO Cargo Search** now incorporates its own independent Cargo data downloader from the unofficial [stowiki.net](https://stowiki.net), the similarity in query structure and result presentation to SETS remains an important part of its heritage.

Both projects are licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3), ensuring compatibility.

Special thanks to the STOCD team for their contributions to the Star Trek Online community and for making valuable resources available for others to build upon.

### STO Wiki Team

The administrators, editors, and contributors to the unofficial [**Star Trek Online Wiki (stowiki.net)**](https://stowiki.net) project.

The Cargo export functionality provided by the wiki and the extensive data curated by the community serve as the foundation for STO Cargo Search. Without their diligent efforts to organize and maintain Star Trek Online's data, this project would not be possible.

We deeply appreciate the STO Wiki team's hard work and dedication to preserving and making accessible detailed game information for the community.
